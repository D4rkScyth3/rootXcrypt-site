### **🔐 Root❌Crypt – How It Works**

*-> The purpose of this tool is simply to make your passwords more secure.*

### **📝 How to use it?**

*1\. Enter your normal password.*
*&nbsp;  - Example: @instagram123*
*2\. Choose a Master Key (this is your secret key that only you know).*
*&nbsp;  - Example: rootxcrypt*
*3\. Click the Encrypt button. The tool will generate a secure encrypted password.*
*&nbsp;  - Example: 9x0a$#...*
*4\. Use this encrypted password as the actual password for your account.*

**🌀 Decryption:**
*-> If you later want to see your real/original password again, just paste the encrypted password into the tool and enter the same Master Key.*
*-> The tool will then reveal your original password.*

**❌ Invalid Protection:**
*-> If you use the wrong Master Key + encrypted password combination, the tool will simply show “Invalid.”*  
*-> This ensures no one can reverse your encrypted password without knowing the correct Master Key.*  

### **💡 Safety Tip:**
*-> Your Master Key is the most important part. Without it, you cannot recover your passwords.*  
*-> For safety, always store your Master Key in a private folder or use a secure password manager.*  
&nbsp;<b>✅ *Recommended: Proton Pass.*  </b>

### <b>💡 Why is this more secure?</b>
*-> Normal/simple passwords are easy to crack.*  
*-> The encrypted password generated by this tool is almost impossible to break.*  
*-> Even if someone gets the encrypted password, they cannot find the original one without your Master Key.*  

### *👉 This means your accounts stay safe, and you don’t have to worry about weak or guessable passwords anymore.*
